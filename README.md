# todo-list-two
Take two of this. Making a to-to list using javascript objects and good programming organization (work in progress).

I used modules but not as much as I could have. Didn't separate the functions well enough. Put too much DOM stuff in the index. 

Didn't fully finish the local storage stuff. Going to come back to this. Needed to move on, spent way too much time on this.
